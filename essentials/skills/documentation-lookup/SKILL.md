# Documentation Lookup

**Priority order:**

1. **Use context7 first** - Resolve library ID, then fetch docs
2. **Web search fallback** - Only if context7 doesn't have it or results are insufficient

**When to activate:**

- User says "check the docs"
- When the source code of a library is not already available locally
- User needs API documentation or code examples
- User mentions a library/framework name
